# QTI Question Types Fix

## Problem
Canvas was rejecting QTI imports with error: "No question type used when trying to parse a qti question"

## Root Cause
The prompt only included a template for Multiple Choice questions. When Copilot generated other question types (Multiple Answers, True/False, Short Answer, Essay, Numerical), it didn't have proper templates showing the exact XML structure required by Canvas.

## Solution Applied
Added complete QTI 1.2 templates for all 6 Canvas question types with correct metadata and XML structure.

## Templates Added

### 1. Multiple Choice (multiple_choice_question)
- `rcardinality="Single"` for single correct answer
- Letter identifiers (A, B, C, D)
- Single `<varequal>` in resprocessing

### 2. Multiple Answers (multiple_answers_question)
- `rcardinality="Multiple"` for multiple correct answers
- Letter identifiers (A, B, C, D)
- `<and>` block listing all correct answers
- `<not>` blocks for incorrect answers

### 3. True/False (true_false_question)
- `ident="true"` and `ident="false"` (lowercase)
- `shuffle="No"` to maintain order
- Single `<varequal>` with true/false value

### 4. Short Answer (short_answer_question)
- `<response_str>` instead of `<response_lid>`
- `fibtype="String"`
- Multiple `<respcondition continue="Yes">` blocks for alternative answers

### 5. Essay (essay_question)
- `<response_str>` with `fibtype="String"`
- Empty `<resprocessing>` (manual grading)
- No scoring conditions

### 6. Numerical (numerical_question)
- `<response_num>` instead of `<response_str>`
- `fibtype="Decimal"`
- `<or>` block with exact value and/or tolerance range
- Use `<vargte>` and `<varlte>` for range

## Critical Requirements Added

The prompt now explicitly states:
- ✅ ALWAYS include `<itemmetadata>` with `question_type` and `points_possible`
- ✅ Use correct question_type value for each type
- ✅ Match response type to question type (`<response_lid>`, `<response_str>`, `<response_num>`)
- ✅ Specific formatting rules for each type

## Prompt Size Impact
- Before: ~5,385 characters
- After: ~12,063 characters
- Still well within Copilot's context window

## Testing
All test cases passed with correct templates for all 6 question types.

## Next Steps
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Generate new quiz with multiple question types
3. Import into Canvas
4. All question types should now import successfully without "No question type" errors
