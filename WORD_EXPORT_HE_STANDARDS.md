### **2. Automatic Title Extraction**

#### **Problem Fixed**
Previously, Study Guide and From Notes used generic titles like "Study Pack" or "Lecture Materials" instead of the actual Panopto video title.

#### **Solution Implemented**
Both prompts now include:

```
CRITICAL: EXTRACT VIDEO TITLE FROM PANOPTO PAGE
Look for the video title in this exact order:
  1. <meta property="og:title" content="..."> — use the content attribute
  2. Element with [data-role="session-title"] or class="session-title"
  3. Page heading (h1) near top of page
  4. document.title (but remove " - Panopto" suffix if present)
Use the ACTUAL VIDEO TITLE from the Panopto page as the main title throughout this study guide.
```

#### **JavaScript Integration**
```javascript
const panoptoTitle = detectPanoptoTitle();
const title = panoptoTitle || 'Study Pack';
const slug = slugify(title);
```

Same robust detection as the Quiz workflow — guarantees correct titles in:
- Title page
- Document header
- Filename (`Introduction_to_Machine_Learning_study.docx`)
- Throughout the content

---

### **3. Higher Education Standards**

#### **New "HIGHER EDUCATION STANDARDS" Section**

Every prompt now includes explicit HE requirements:

```
HIGHER EDUCATION STANDARDS
This is for independent university-level study. Content must:
• Encourage critical thinking and independent analysis, not passive memorization
• Include "why" explanations and conceptual connections, not just "what" facts
• Link ideas across topics and to broader disciplinary contexts
• Promote metacognitive awareness (how to learn, not just what to learn)
• Reference timestamps throughout for students to verify/deepen understanding
• Use academic register appropriate for HE while remaining accessible
• Support students in becoming independent learners who can extend beyond the lecture
```

#### **What This Means in Practice**

##### **Before (Generic)**:
```
Q: What is photosynthesis?
A: The process plants use to make food from sunlight.
```

##### **After (HE Standard)**:
```
**FC-12** [Intermediate]
Q: Explain why photosynthesis is considered an endergonic process and how plants overcome this thermodynamic challenge.
A: Photosynthesis stores energy in glucose bonds (ΔG > 0), making it endergonic. Plants overcome this by coupling it to light energy absorption, which provides sufficient free energy to drive the unfavorable reaction forward.
Explanation: This connects to broader principles of thermodynamics and energy coupling found throughout metabolism. Understanding the energetic requirements helps explain why plants need light and why chlorophyll structure matters.

#### **Example Flashcard (Full Spec)**

**In-Document**:
```
**FC-18** [Advanced]
Q: Why does increasing substrate concentration eventually fail to increase reaction rate in enzyme-catalyzed reactions?
A: All enzyme active sites become saturated (Vmax reached); adding more substrate cannot increase rate because no free enzymes are available to bind additional substrate molecules.
Explanation: This illustrates the difference between zero-order and first-order kinetics and explains why Michaelis-Menten kinetics shows a hyperbolic curve. Understanding saturation is crucial for interpreting experimental data and designing enzyme assays.
Source: [34:15] - Enzyme kinetics and saturation
Difficulty: Advanced

    • "What I understand confidently" (with evidence)
    • "What remains unclear" (specific questions to pursue)
    • "How this connects to [previous topic/other modules]"
    • "What I'd like to explore further" (with suggested starting points)
    • "My study approach" (what worked, what to adjust)
    Include guidance on effective self-explanation and monitoring understanding.
```

**From Notes**:
```
11) Reflection & metacognition — Structured prompts:
    • What I understand confidently (with evidence)
    • What remains unclear (specific questions)
    • How this connects to other topics/modules
    • What to explore further (with suggestions)
    • My study approach (what to adjust)
```

#### **HE-Level Depth**
Not just "what did I learn?" but:
- Evidence-based self-assessment
- Connecting across modules/topics
- Identifying knowledge gaps precisely
- Planning independent exploration
- Evaluating study strategies

---

### **10. Worked Examples: Expert Thinking**

#### **New Requirements**
```
7) Worked examples — 3–6 problems with detailed numbered steps, "why this step" rationale, 
conceptual explanation, and a "common errors" box. Show expert thinking process. 
Each example includes:
- Timestamp reference to related lecture segment
- Connection to learning outcomes
- Extension question for independent practice
```

#### **Example Structure**
```
**Worked Example 3: Calculating Enzyme Efficiency [28:15]**

Problem: An enzyme processes 500 substrate molecules per second. Its Km is 0.05 mM. 
At what substrate concentration will the reaction rate be 75% of Vmax?

Expert Approach:
Step 1: Recognize this requires the Michaelis-Menten equation
  Why: We're relating rate to substrate concentration with known Km
  Equation: v = (Vmax × [S]) / (Km + [S])

Step 2: Set v = 0.75 Vmax and solve for [S]
  Why: 75% of Vmax is our target rate
  0.75 Vmax = (Vmax × [S]) / (Km + [S])

Step 3: Algebraic manipulation
  Why: Isolate [S] to find the answer
  0.75(Km + [S]) = [S]
  0.75Km = 0.25[S]
  [S] = 3Km = 0.15 mM

Common Errors:
❌ Confusing Km with Vmax
❌ Using Lineweaver-Burk equation (unnecessary here)
❌ Forgetting units (must match Km units)

Connection to Learning Outcomes: Demonstrates LO3 (Apply M-M kinetics) and LO5 (Interpret concentration effects)

Extension: How would this change if a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.02 mM, [I] = 0.01 mM) were present? 
(Hint: Calculate apparent Km first) [See 42:30 for inhibition]
```

---

### **11. Problem Sets: Progressive Difficulty**

#### **New Specification**
```
8) Problem set & solutions — 8–15 questions progressing from recall → application → extension.
Mix question types: computational, conceptual, analytical. Include graduated hints (3 levels).
Solutions section provides:
- Model answer
- Step-by-step rationale
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Timestamp for related content
- "Extend your thinking" prompt
```

#### **Example Problem with Graduated Hints**

**Problem 5** [Apply]:
Calculate the pH of a 0.1 M acetic acid solution (Ka = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵). Show all steps.

**Hint 1** (Minimal): What type of equilibrium is this? Write the Ka expression.

**Hint 2** (Moderate): Set up an ICE table. Can you make any simplifying assumptions?

**Hint 3** (Substantial): Use the approximation [H+] = √(Ka × Ca) if Ca/Ka > 100. Check validity after.

**Solution**:
Given: [HA]₀ = 0.1 M, Ka = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵

Step 1: Check if approximation is valid
  0.1 / (1.8 × 10⁻⁵) = 5,556 > 100 ✓ Approximation valid

Step 2: Calculate [H+]
  [H+] = √(Ka × Ca) = √(1.8 × 10⁻⁵ × 0.1) = 1.34 × 10⁻³ M

Step 3: Calculate pH
  pH = -log(1.34 × 10⁻³) = 2.87

Common Mistakes:
❌ Forgetting to check approximation validity (leads to wrong answer if [HA] is low)
❌ Using full quadratic when approximation works (correct but inefficient)
❌ Confusing Ka with pKa

Timestamp: [22:15-25:40] - Weak acid pH calculations

Extend Your Thinking:
How would the pH change if this were a 0.1 M sodium acetate solution instead? (Hint: This is a weak base problem; consider Kb = Kw/Ka)
```
