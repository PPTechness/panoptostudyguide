## 🎯 Latest Fix: Panopto Title Extraction

### Problem Solved
Copilot was not consistently extracting the actual Panopto video title from the browser page, resulting in generic filenames like "Lecture_Quiz_qti.zip" instead of meaningful titles like "Week_5_Cell_Division_Dr_Ahmed_quiz_qti.zip".

### Solution Implemented
**5-Checkpoint Defense System** across both Canvas Quiz and Study Guide workflows:

#### Checkpoint 1: PANOPTO_BLOCK (First Instruction)
```
❗️ CRITICAL: EXTRACT REAL VIDEO TITLE FROM PANOPTO PAGE ❗️
This is MANDATORY. You MUST extract the actual video title. Look in this exact order:
  1. <meta property="og:title" content="..."> (MOST RELIABLE)
  2. Element with [data-role="session-title"] or class="session-title"
  3. Page heading (h1 near video player)
  4. document.title (remove " - Panopto" suffix)

EXAMPLE: If you find <meta property="og:title" content="Week 5: Cell Division - Dr. Ahmed">
  ✅ CORRECT: LECTURE_TITLE = "Week 5: Cell Division - Dr. Ahmed"
  ❌ WRONG:   LECTURE_TITLE = "Lecture Quiz" (DO NOT USE)
```

#### Checkpoint 2: TITLE & FILENAMES / TITLE EXTRACTION (Middle)
- Full extraction instructions repeated with concrete examples
- Shows transformation: "Week 3: Neural Networks - Prof. Johnson" → "Week_3_Neural_Networks_Prof_Johnson"
- Explicitly forbids placeholders like "Lecture Quiz", "Study Guide"

#### Checkpoint 3: VALIDATION (Pre-Output)
- Added as checkpoint #2: "VIDEO TITLE extracted correctly from Panopto page (not a placeholder)"
- Forces Copilot to verify before generating files

#### Checkpoint 4: FINAL CHECK (Last Instruction)
```
FINAL CHECK: Did you use the ACTUAL Panopto video title or a placeholder?
Check og:title, [data-role="session-title"], h1, or document.title before outputting.
```

#### Checkpoint 5: OUTPUT Reinforcement
- Reminds to use actual title in filenames
- Shows examples of correct vs. wrong filenames

### Why This Works
- **Visual emphasis**: ❗️ emojis and "CRITICAL" language
- **Repetition**: Same instruction appears 5 times in different forms
- **Concrete examples**: Real titles like "Week 5: Cell Division - Dr. Ahmed"
- **Negative examples**: Explicitly shows what NOT to do
- **Validation**: Multiple checkpoints catch failures

### Result
✅ **Canvas Quiz**: Filenames like `Week_5_Cell_Division_Dr_Ahmed_quiz_qti.zip`  
✅ **Study Guide**: Filenames like `Lecture_3_Neural_Networks_study.docx`  
✅ **No generic placeholders**: "Lecture_Quiz" or "Study_Guide" are forbidden  
✅ **Character count**: Still under 8,000 (Quiz: ~4,750, Study Guide: ~5,400)
