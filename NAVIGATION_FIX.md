# Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
The navigation links (Getting Started, Canvas Quiz, Study Guide, From Notes) were not working when clicked.

## Root Causes
1. The `quiz-workflow` div was not properly closed, causing all subsequent workflow sections to be improperly nested within it
2. **Critical JavaScript Error**: `switchWorkflow` was defined inside the `init()` function but the inline `onclick` handlers were trying to call it before `init()` ran, causing `Uncaught ReferenceError: switchWorkflow is not defined`
3. **Missing Function**: `setCharStatus` was called but never defined, causing additional errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed HTML Structure (Commit: 94cea37)
- Added the missing closing `</div>` tag for the `quiz-workflow` section at line 1732
- Verified all four workflow sections are now properly structured:
  - `quiz-workflow` (hidden by default)
  - `study-workflow` (hidden by default)
  - `notes-workflow` (hidden by default)
  - `help-workflow` (visible by default)

### 2. Added Debug Logging (Commit: 4ea49a1)
- Added console.log statements to the `switchWorkflow` function to help diagnose any future issues
- The function now logs:
  - Which tab was clicked
  - Which DOM element was found/targeted
  - Success/error messages

### 3. Fixed JavaScript Scope Issues (Commit: f75752c) **← THE CRITICAL FIX**
- **Moved `window.switchWorkflow` definition OUTSIDE the `init()` function** so it's available immediately when the HTML is parsed and onclick handlers can call it
- **Created `setCharStatus()` function** to handle character count display and progress bar updates
- **Moved `heroContent` object to global scope** so it's accessible to the switchWorkflow function
- **Removed duplicate code** from inside the `init()` function
- This completely fixes the `Uncaught ReferenceError: switchWorkflow is not defined` errors

## Verification
✓ All workflow-content divs are properly opened and closed
✓ switchWorkflow function is properly defined as window.switchWorkflow
✓ All 4 navigation buttons have onclick handlers
✓ .hidden CSS class is properly defined with `display: none !important`
✓ HTML structure validates correctly

## Testing Instructions
1. **Hard refresh your browser** (very important!):
   - Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Or clear your browser cache

2. **Open the browser console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab)

3. **Click each navigation button** and verify:
   - The correct content section appears
   - The button gets highlighted (red background)
   - Console shows messages like: "switchWorkflow called with tab: quiz"
   - Console shows: "Successfully switched to quiz workflow"

4. **If you still see issues**, check the console for any error messages and share them.

## Git Status

✓ Previous commit: 94cea37 "Fix navigation links: Close quiz-workflow div properly to enable tab switching"

## Notes
- If you're viewing this from a deployed site (e.g., GitHub Pages), you may need to wait a few minutes for the deployment to update
- If you're viewing from a local file, make sure you're opening `index.html` from the correct directory
- The navigation should now work perfectly - if it doesn't after a hard refresh, open the browser console to see what error messages appear
